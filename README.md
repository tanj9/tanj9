# Jérôme Tan

Hello, I'm Jérôme 👋🏼

I just finished a 9 week bootcamp in **full stack web development** at **Le Wagon (Paris)** to start a new life as a **developer**🤓. Previous to that I have worked for 20 years in the energy sector. My plan is now to work on **green IT projects** because I am concerned by climate change and wish to reduce in all possible ways the negative impacts digital has on nature as well as on society. :earth_africa:

I am a very curious person, eager to learn always more. Amongst others, I am passionate about **mountains** :mountain_snow:, **languages** and **maps** :world_map:.

- :seedling: I learned Ruby, SQL, Rails, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, ES6, JS, wireframing on Figma/Sketch
